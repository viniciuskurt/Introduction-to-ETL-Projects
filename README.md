# Introduction to ETL Projects

 **Repository created to develop my first ETL project in Python.**


## Project Objective

The objective of the project is to extract data from the **Aeronautical Occurrences** file to Validate, Clean and Transform the data, generating new information that can be used in decision making that can facilitate or improve the reduction in the number of air incidents in the Brazil.

----------------------------------------

For this project, we will use a dataset provided by CENIPA (Centre for Investigation and Prevention of Aeronautical Accidents) which has data on Air Occurrences in Brazilian Civil Aviation, and is available free of charge on the website:
**CSV occurrence table
Aeronautical Occurrences.**

Data are available in csv files.

 https://dados.gov.br/dataset/ocorrencias-aeronauticas-da-aviacao-civil-brasileira

Among the information available are data on the aircraft involved, fatalities, location, date, time of events and taxonomic information typical of accident investigations.

--------------------------------

## <center>This project is divided into 4 steps:</center>

## Step 1 - Data Extraction

For the project we will use several data contained in the csv file. We will delete some columns in the **ocorrencia_2010_2020** file and create a new file called **ocorrencia_2010_2020_v2** .

## Step 2 - Data Validation

## Step 3 - Data Cleaning

## Step 4 - Data Transformation
